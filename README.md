In the realm of intellectual property for images, the presence of watermarks is a common concern. Nowadays, it is common to find online images with visible watermarks. To address this challenge, various techniques have been developed to remove these marks. However, many of these strategies require a manual process to detect the watermark before it can be removed, which can be laborious and inefficient.

In this work, we propose to apply the watermark detection method proposed in the article [An Automatic Visible Watermark Detection Method using Total Variation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7935109) and evaluate its effectiveness on various types of images and different watermarks. Through these analyses, we aim to improve the efficiency of the watermark detection and removal process in images. This advancement can be useful for enhancing the aesthetics of images, facilitating their reuse and modification, maintaining visual coherence, recovering valuable images, and protecting privacy in different contexts.

In this repository you can find a notebook with the code of the project and the presentation we used to present our work.
